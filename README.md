# magiNote

An AI notetaking app that allows you to rapid-fire your thoughts. Don't worry about formatting anything, we've got it covered!

## 🚀 Overview

I originally came up with the idea for magiNote when taking Geology 1010. My professor moved very quickly and didn't post any of his slides online, so keeping up was difficult.
I realized that the majority of my time was being spent formatting my notes and making them look "pretty", so I decided to outsource that work.
Testing a prototyped version of this app in class turned out to be a huge success! When I mentioned the app to a friend, he told me he'd like to try it as well.

Although very simple, this app has allowed me to expand my learning on web app development and to create a tool that both my friends and I can use to help us with our studies.
